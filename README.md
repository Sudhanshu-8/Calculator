# Calculator App ðŸ§®

A Java Swing-based Calculator application designed for performing arithmetic operations with a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Perform arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- Clear button to reset calculations.  
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully with error messages.  
- Responsive and intuitive interface for seamless usage.  

## Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
   cd calculator-app
   ```

2. **Open the project in your favorite Java IDE**  
   For example, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

3. **Compile and run the program**  
   - Locate the `Calculator.java` file in your IDE.  
   - Run the `Calculator` class to launch the application.  

## How It Works

The calculator leverages Java Swing to create a graphical user interface (GUI). It uses event-driven programming to handle button clicks and performs calculations based on user input. The results are dynamically displayed in the text field.

### Key Features of the Code:
- **GridLayout for Buttons**: Arranges buttons in a 4x4 grid for a clean layout.  
- **ActionListener**: Handles button interactions and implements the calculation logic.  
- **Error Handling**: Ensures invalid inputs or divide-by-zero errors are managed gracefully.
